## Final Project

### Home Automation

An Internet of Things (IoT) application incorporated with a MQTT broker and microcontrollers, that allows the user to acess the status of their household items.  

Household items range from lights, windows, and doors. Users can view the status of their household items from the dashboard. On the dashboard, users can check if certain windows and doors are open or closed, and which lights are turned on or off.  

Furthermore, users receive the current temperature; both indoor and outdoor.
